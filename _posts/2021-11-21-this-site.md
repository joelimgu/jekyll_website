I created [this site](https://joelimgu.github.io/) using Jekyll in order to have one centralised place where I could have all the stuff I want to 
share.
After trying multiple technologies Jekyll is the simplest and most maintainable one.
It's based on the [kasper theme](https://github.com/rosario/kasper).

This site is ment to be a display for my work and project as well as a repository for all the doc and tutorials I've
created for myself or others.
