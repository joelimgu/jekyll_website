This project was my way to learn the Rust programming language.

### Project description
Ever wanted to watch YouTube though ssh? Me  neither but that's the only use I can think of for this project.
It enables you to browse YouTube and watch videos using a tui and thus not needing a GUI!

Here is a demonstration of how it works:
<video controls width="95%">
    <source src="{{ site.url }}/assets/videos/youtube_tui_example.mp4"
            type="video/mp4">
</video>

### Why?
I started makes an image viewer in Rust for the sake if it just to play with the language and then a friend 
wanted to build that, so we just did it. Now is one of the project I am most proud of XD.

The code is horrible as it was my first project in Rust and I didn't bother with error handling any more than the strict
necessary.
