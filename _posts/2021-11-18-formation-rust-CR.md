This is a recap page for the introduction to Rust presentation I did for the [Robotics Club of INSA Toulouse](https://clubrobotinsat.github.io/).

Here is the summary of the points treated, keep in mind those are cherry-picked in the goal of coding embedded systems in rust.
That's why for example multi-threading and most std features were not included. 
Other's like lifetimes were excluded for simplicity as the objective was to introduce the language in less than 3h.
